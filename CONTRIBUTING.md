## Branching Processes

Pull requests should be made against the `main` branch.

While not mandatory, we encourage the use of prefixed branches. These are the currently used prefixes:

`content`: edits applying to site content.
`feature`: new features for the website.
`fix`: fixes an error in existing code.

## Merging Processes

1. As mentioned above, your contribution will be a branch based off of `main`
2. Once it's ready for review, please create a new [Pull Request](https://github.com/trufflesuite/trufflesuite.com/compare) to be merged into (aka base branch) `main`
3. Upon creation of a Pull Request, a preview build will be generated in the CI output in the comment thread. Click on the "Details" link to the right of the `fleek/build` row to view.
4. PRs from Truffle team members require at least one review approval; PRs from external contributors are recommended (though not required) to have >1 review
5. PRs that pass all automatic checks **and** meet the approval criteria above may be merged by anyone (though give the author time to merge it themselves, as they deserve the satisfaction of pushing the button)
    - After a PR has been merged, **please delete the original branch**

## Translating

We welcome translations as well. If you are interested in translating Truffle documentation to a different language:

1. Copy the content you wish to translate (feel free to fork the repository).
2. Host the translated documentation (you can use [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) or any hosting solution).
3. [Create an issue](https://github.com/trufflesuite/trufflesuite.com/issues) pointing to your hosted translations.

We will then review and link to your documentation. Thank you!
