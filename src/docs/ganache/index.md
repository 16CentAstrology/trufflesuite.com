# Overview

[Ganache](/ganache) is a personal blockchain for rapid Ethereum and Corda distributed application development. You can use Ganache across the entire development cycle; enabling you to develop, deploy, and test your dApps in a safe and deterministic environment.

Ganache comes in two flavors: a UI and CLI. Ganache UI is a desktop application supporting both Ethereum and Corda technology. The command-line tool, [ganache-cli](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache-cli-archive) (formerly known as the TestRPC), is available for Ethereum development. Prefer using the command-line? This documentation will focus only on the UI flavor of Ganache. Please see the [Ganache CLI Readme](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache-cli-archive/blob/master/README.md) for command-line documentation.

All versions of Ganache are available for Windows, Mac, and Linux.
