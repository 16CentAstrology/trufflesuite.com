# Connect to Infura

Truffle for VSCode allows users to create a new instance, or connect to an existing instance, of the
[Infura](https://infura.io/) service directly from VSCode.
This enables developers to reduce time moving between portal and IDE.

## Create a new Infura service

If you don't have an existing Infura service deployed, you can create one in any account you have
access to.

1. Create a new Infura service by doing one of the following:
   - In the [command palette](../reference/command-palette.md), type **Truffle: Create a new network**.
   - Use the ellipsis menu in the **Truffle - Networks view**.
   - Use the shortcuts in the **Truffle - Networks view**.
1. A prompt displays to log in to the Infura service, if you haven't already.
1. Enter the project name.
1. Enter the project visibility.
   The default is public.

## Connect to existing Infura projects

1. Connect to an existing Infura account/project by doing one of the following:
   - In the [command palette](../reference/command-palette.md), type **Truffle: Connect to network**.
   - Use the ellipsis menu in the **Truffle - Networks view**.
   - Use the shortcuts in the **Truffle - Networks view**.
1. A prompt displays to log in to the Infura service, if you haven't already.
