The Truffle for VSCode Extension, allows users to create a new instance, or connect to an existing instance, of the Infura Service directly from VS Code. This enables developers to remain productive in their IDE, reducing time moving from portal to IDE etc.

1. There are a few ways to create a new Infura Service.

   1. One way is to use the Command Palette and select either `Truffle: Create a new network`.

   3. Finally, if no other networks have been created, shortcuts are provided in the `Truffle - Networks view`

2. If a previous login was not done to Infura, a prompt will be shown to allow login to the Infura service.
