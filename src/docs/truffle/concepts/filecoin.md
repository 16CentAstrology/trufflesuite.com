# Filecoin support

Truffle provides [Filecoin](https://docs.filecoin.io/) integration that works out of the box, meaning
there's no need to install any special Truffle version.

View the [Filecoin box](https://github.com/truffle-box/filecoin-box/blob/master/README.md) tutorial to learn
how to use Truffle to build dapps on the Filecoin network.
