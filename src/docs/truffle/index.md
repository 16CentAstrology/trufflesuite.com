# What is Truffle?

A world class development environment, testing framework and asset pipeline for blockchains using the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), aiming to make life as a developer easier. With Truffle, you get:

* Built-in smart contract compilation, linking, deployment and binary management.
* [Advanced debugging](/docs/truffle/how-to/debug-test/use-the-truffle-debugger) with breakpoints, variable analysis, and step functionality.
* Use [console.log](/docs/truffle/reference/configuration/#soliditylog) in your smart contracts
* Deployments and transactions through MetaMask with [Truffle Dashboard](/docs/truffle/how-to/use-the-truffle-dashboard) to protect your mnemonic.
* External script runner that executes scripts within a Truffle environment.
* Interactive console for direct contract communication.
* Automated contract testing for rapid development.
* Scriptable, extensible deployment & migrations framework.
* Network management for deploying to any number of public & private networks.
* Package management with NPM, using the [ERC190](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/190) standard.
* Configurable build pipeline with support for tight integration.
