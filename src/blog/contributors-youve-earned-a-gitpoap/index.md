Hey Trufflesuite contributors, we’re excited to share that in collaboration with the [GitPOAP](https://gitpoap.io/) team, we will be issuing POAPs in appreciation of your awesome contributions over the years. 

## What are POAPs?

POAPs (Proof Of Attendance Protocol) are badges issued as NFTs (non-fungible token) to prove that the recipient/owner has carried out an action or has attended an event. They are like gold medals from the Olympics, except these exist as digital collectibles. 

## Who's eligible to claim a GitPOAP?

Great question. Annual contributor POAPs will be issued to those who have contributed at least once all year since the start of the following projects:

- Ganache
- Truffle
- trufflesuite.com website

Those of you who have contributed to all three projects can claim all three POAPs! 

Here are some POAPs you should expect to receive as a TruffleSuite contributor:

## How and when can I claim my POAP?

POAPs will be issued as NFTs, so contributors must authenticate with their GitHub accounts on the [GitPOAP website](https://gitpoap.io/) to claim their POAP.

All POAPs are minted on Gnosis Chain (Formerly xDai). There is no cost to claim your POAP and it can be migrated to the Ethereum mainnet if you pay the gas fee for the transaction. Learn how to do that [here](https://intercom.help/poap/en/articles/5790336-how-do-i-migrate-my-poap-to-mainnet).

The official start date for claiming is April 7, 2022, so mark your calendars and claim your GitPOAP as soon as possible.

Thanks to the [GitPOAP](https://twitter.com/gitpoap) team for selecting the Trufflesuite of tools as one of the lucky few projects in their launch cohort.
