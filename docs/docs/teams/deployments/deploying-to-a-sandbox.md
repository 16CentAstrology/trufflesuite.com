# Deploying to a sandbox

To deploy to a sandbox, be sure that you have already created a sandbox, or head to the <a href="/docs/teams/sandboxes/creating-a-sandbox">Creating a sandbox</a> section of our documentation for more information.

Follow the steps in <a href="/docs/teams/deployments/creating-a-deployment">Creating a Deployment</a> to start a deployment. At the second step, <a href="docs/teams/deployments/creating-a-deployment#select-network-and-connect-wallet">Select network and connect wallet</a>, you'll see the name of your available sandboxes in the **Destination Network** dropdown.

The **Deployment Account** section that appears after selecting a sandbox allows you to specify which of the 10 auto-generated accounts to use for the deployment. By selecting one of these accounts, all transactions will automatically be confirmed using the specified account. You can optionally select **MetaMask** to confirm your own transactions through MetaMask like you would for any other network.
