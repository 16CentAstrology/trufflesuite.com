# Deployment console

The deployment console is where you can find all of the output from the deployment process. This can be helpful in debugging when a deployment fails or for better understanding of the overall deployment process. To access the deployment console, navigate to the respective [deployment details page](/docs/teams/deployments/deployment-details) and click the **CONSOLE** tab.
