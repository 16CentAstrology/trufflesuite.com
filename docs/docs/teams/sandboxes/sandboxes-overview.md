# Sandboxes overview

Sandboxes are shared Ganache instances you can create with the click of a button. Convenient features of Ganache's local development experience are now available to the whole team! Each sandbox has 10 pre-funded accounts and near-instant transaction times giving your team a performant, turnkey blockchain environment without spending a single wei on transactions.
