# Renaming a sandbox

By default, we generate a random name for each sandbox. To rename a sandbox, first click <span class="inline-button">VIEW/EDIT</span>. You'll see a modal with the sandbox details, including a text input with the name. Fill in the new name you would like and click <span class="inline-button">CONFIRM</span> to save the new name.
