# Creating a sandbox

Creating a sandbox is as easy as clicking <span class="inline-button">NEW SANDBOX</span>.

<figure class="screenshot">
  <img class="w-100" src="/img/docs/teams/sandboxes.png" alt="Truffle Teams SANDBOXES screen">
  <figcaption class="text-center">The Truffle Teams Sandboxes screen.</figcaption>
</figure>

You'll see all the details necessary to start using this sandbox, including the `mnemonic` and `network_id`. Want to use sandboxes with Truffle? See the <a href="/docs/teams/sandboxes/usage-with-truffle">Usage with Truffle</a> documentation.
