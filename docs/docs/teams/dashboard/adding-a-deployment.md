# Adding a deployment

To get started with the dashboard, first you will need to select a repository and [deploy your DApp](/docs/teams/deployments/creating-a-deployment). Once you have a deployment available, you can select that deployment to monitor via the dashboard by clicking <span class="inline-button">ADD DEPLOYMENT</span>.

Once you have added a deployment to monitor, you will be taken to the main dashboard page where you can see at-a-glance information about your deployment.
