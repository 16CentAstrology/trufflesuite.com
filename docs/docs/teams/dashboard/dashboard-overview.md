# Dashboard overview

The Truffle Teams dashboard allows you to get at-a-glance information about the health of a deployed DApp such as a link to the commit which was deployed, the cost of your deployment, and transactions over time.

To learn more and get started with the dashboard, head over to the <a href="/docs/teams/dashboard/adding-a-deployment">Adding a deployment</a> section of the dashboard documentation.
