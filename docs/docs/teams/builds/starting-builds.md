# Starting builds

Builds will start automatically once a new commit is pushed to any branch of any repository added to Truffle Teams. The build will be queued in both Truffle Teams and on GitHub with the commit itself.

To see the build as it progresses, click on **<span class="inline-menu-item"><i class="fal fa-tasks"></i> BUILDS</span>**.

<p class="alert alert-warning">
<i class="far fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> <strong>Note</strong>: Truffle Teams will only build repositories who have a Truffle project at the root of the repository. It looks for a <code>truffle-config.js</code> or <code>truffle.js</code> config in the root directory before building. Read more in the <a href="/docs/teams/reference/configuration#repository-structure">Configuration docs</a>.
