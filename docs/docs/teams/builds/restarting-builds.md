## Restarting builds

If for whatever reason a build failed and you want to restart it, it is possible to manually retrigger the build by clicking **<span class="inline-button"><i class="far fa-redo"></i> RESTART BUILD</span>** next to the specific build on the **<span class="inline-menu-item"><i class="fal fa-tasks"></i>BUILDS</span>** page. 

Note: **<span class="inline-button"><i class="far fa-redo"></i> RESTART BUILD</i></span>** will be disabled for any in progress builds or builds using an external CI provider (such as Travis CI or CircleCI) as you would have to restart the build through your external CI providers interface.
