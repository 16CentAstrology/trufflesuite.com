# Claim a 1-month trial

Every Truffle Teams account is eligible for a free 1-month trial that includes all Pro features. Navigate to your account settings by clicking on your username or GitHub avatar in the sidebar.

If you're apart of one or many organizations, a list of the the organizations you belong to will appear in the sidebar. You can click on the organization's name or or GitHub avatar to view and/or manage the organization's settings.

You should now see the **BILLLING** settings page for the selected account. If this account is still eligible for a trial, you'll be able to see and click on **<span class="inline-button">CLAIM TRIAL</span>** to claim your free 1 month pro trial.
