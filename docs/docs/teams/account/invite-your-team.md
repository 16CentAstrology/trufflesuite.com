# Invite your team

Inviting your team is as easy as inviting someone to your GitHub organization! Once your team has been added to your GitHub organization they can head on over to Truffle Teams, <a href="https://my.truffleteams.com" target="_blank">https://my.truffleteams.com</a>, and sign up with their own GitHub account. For more information on creating accounts, check out the <a href="/docs/teams/getting-started/creating-an-account">Creating an account</a> section of our documentation.
