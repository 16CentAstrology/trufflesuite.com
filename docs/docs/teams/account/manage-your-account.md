There will be three or four tabs to toggle between, depending on your permissions, on the settings page:

1. [Billing](#billing-and-plans)
1. [Builds](#builds)
1. [Advanced](#advanced)
1. [Users](#users) (this tab will only appear if you are a part of an organization)

## Billing and plans

When you sign up for Truffle Teams you are automatically enrolled in the Free plan. The Free plan comes with unlimited builds, monitoring of unlimited contracts, unlimited deployments to Sandboxes, testnets, and mainnet, and access to 1 Ganache sandbox. However, the Free plan is limited to public repositories.

You can upgrade to Pro or enterprise plans at anytime. For a Pro plan, you'll get everything that comes with the Free plan plus private repositories and access to 3 Ganache Sandboxes. <a href="/docs/teams/account/claim-a-1-month-trial">Try out Pro for a free month</a>!

To upgrade to a Pro plan, click **BILLING > UPGRADE** and you'll be prompted to enter your billing information and payment method. If you're interested in our enterprise plan, <a href="mailto:sales@trufflesuite.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="sc-dymIpo jtCNSr sc-ktHwxA isqCSL">contact us</a> to get a tailored experience for you and your team.

If you have subscribed to the Pro plan and for any reason would like to switch back to the Free plan, click **BILLING** then select the **FREE** plan by clicking **<span class="inline-button">SWITCH</span>**. You will continue to receive Pro services until the end of your billing period.

### Close your account

If for any reason you would like to close your account, click on **BILLING**, scroll to the bottom of the page to the **Close Account** section. As a forewarning, if you close your account the data associated with your account will become inaccessible. If you're sure you want to close your account, go ahead and click **<span class="inline-button red">I UNDERSTAND, CLOSE MY ACCOUNT</span>**. As a security measure, you'll be prompted to type in your account name and click **<span class="inline-button">CLOSE</span>** to confirm.

## Builds

The **BUILDS** tab is where you can update specific repositories to use external CI providers instead of the Truffle Teams' internal CI test runner. For more information, check out our documentation on <a href="/docs/teams/testing/external-ci">External CI</a>.

## Advanced

The advanced tab is where you can opt-in to early access features that are cutting-edge but potentially unstable. If you do decide to opt-in and discover any bugs, please let us know on our <a href="https://spectrum.chat/trufflesuite/truffle-teams">Truffle Teams Spectrum support channel</a>!

## Users

The **USERS** tab will only appear if you are a part of an organization. Here you can find a list of users within the organization and their permissions. This information can be particularaly useful if you need to view or manage your teams permissions.
