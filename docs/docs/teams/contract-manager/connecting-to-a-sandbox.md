# Connecting to a sandbox

<p class="alert alert-warning">
<i class="far fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> <strong>Note</strong>: The contract manager is currently available as part of our <strong>Early Access</strong> program, which when enabled gives you access to cutting-edge and potentially unstable features. It requires opting-in; navigate to your account settings by clicking on your username or GitHub avatar in the sidebar. Click <strong>ADVANCED</strong> and choose <strong>Early Access</strong>.
</p>

Please note, this section of the documentation assumes that you have already created a sandbox and deployed your contracts to the sandbox. If you need help getting started with sandboxes and deployments to sandboxes, please check out the <a href="/docs/teams/sandboxes/creating-a-sandbox">creating a sandbox</a> section and the <a href="/docs/teams/deployments/deploying-to-a-sandbox">deploying to a sandbox</a> section for more details.

If you deployed your contract to a sandbox and would like to interact with it using the contract manager, you'll need to have your MetaMask connected to your sandbox instance. To connect MetaMask to your sandbox, you'll need the RPC URL and the generated mnemonic. Navigate to **<span class="inline-menu-item"><i class="far fa-cubes"></i>SANDBOXES</span>** and click on <span class="inline-button">VIEW/EDIT</span> of the sandbox you deployed to. Copy the **Mnemonic**, open your MetaMask browser extension, and select **Import using account seed phrase**.

A new tab will open for restoring your account with a seed phrase/mnemonic; paste the mnemonic into the **Wallet Seed** text box, create a password, and click **Restore**.

Once you have successfully logged into MetaMask via seed phrase, next you'll need to create a custom RPC using the sandbox RPC URL. Copy the **RPC URL**, open your MetaMask browser extension, click on the Network dropdown list, select **Custom RPC** from the bottom of the list. Enter a network name, paste the RPC URL into the **New RPC URL** text box, enter in Ganache's Chain ID: `1337`, and any other relevant information, and click **Save**.

If you click on the MetaMask logo it'll take you back to your account details where you should see a test account with 100 ETH. Now you're connected to MetaMask and can head over to the contract manager to interact with your contract.

Navigate to the **<span class="inline-menu-item"><i class="fal fa-parachute-box"></i>DEPLOYMENTS</span>** page, toggle to **TABLE** view, and select the deployment from your list of deployments. On the chosen deployment page, under the **CONTRACTS** tab, you can chose a contract to interact with by clicking on **<span class="inline-button"><i class="far fa-pager"></i> MANAGE</span>**.

A MetaMask pop-up will appear asking you to select an account to use, choose which account to use from the list and click **Next**, and finally accept the permissions by clicking **Connect**. You've successfully selected an account, now you're ready to interact with the contract manager! To learn more on interacting with contracts, head over to the <a href="/docs/teams/contract-manager/interacting-with-functions">Interacting with functions</a> section.
