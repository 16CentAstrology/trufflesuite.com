## Getting started

To use the contract manager, you must have a deployed contract instance. If you need help deploying a contract, check out the <a href="/docs/teams/deployments/creating-a-deployment">Creating a Deployment</a> section to learn more. Once you've deployed your contract, navigate to the **<span class="inline-menu-item"><i class="fal fa-parachute-box"></i>DEPLOYMENTS</span>** page, toggle to **TABLE** view, and select the deployment from your list of deployments. On the chosen deployment page, under the **CONTRACTS** tab, you can chose a contract to interact with by clicking on **<span class="inline-button"><i class="far fa-pager"></i> MANAGE</span>**.

Once you've successfully navigated to the contract manager, you'll see two sections: **State** and **Functions**. The **State** section provides a quick glance at all of the public state variables in your contract. The **Functions** section allows you to interact with your deployed contract instance. To learn more on how to interact with your public contract functions, take a look at the <a href="/docs/teams/contract-manager/interacting-with-functions">Interacting with functions</a> section.
